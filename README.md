# RunTracker
Simple app for logging my running.

# Python
* Will be using pandas to prepare the data from my existing spreadsheets.
    * Initially a one time use however may revisit later to create an import tool that parses the .csv export availabe through Garmin Connect.
* Use psycopg to populate database with running data to be used in the other parts of this application.
* Also intend on using seaborn to create visuals from the data eventually.
